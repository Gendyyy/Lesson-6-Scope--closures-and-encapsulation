This lab was an excellent opportunity to practice and reinforce the concepts of object-oriented programming in JavaScript, particularly with prototypes and constructors. It was interesting to see how different approaches  can achieve similar outcomes. The most challenging part was ensuring proper inheritance and method overriding. Overall, the exercises took approximately 2 hours to complete and test, with the majority of the time spent on debugging and refining the code to meet the specifications.
